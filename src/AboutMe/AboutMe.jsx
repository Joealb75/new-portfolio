          I plan and build full-stack applications using React(JS), Python,
          Django, TailwindCSS, SQL and Figma.

          <br />
          But how did I get here?
          <br />
          <br />
          In June 2023 I was 1 year into being a Real Estate agent when the
          Interest Rates started to rise and finding business started to get
          more challenging at least for me, I am not from TN so my connections
          were limited. It was at this point where I decided that I wanted to
          gain another valuable skill set that could provide me with consistent
          income.
          <br />
          <br />
          Then one night in July I was watching Mr.Robot and thought "Hollywood
          makes coding seems so complicated, is it really that hard?" so I went
          on amazon and bought the book{" "}

          By Zed Shaw. I worked through his book on and off over the next couple
          months, and through that process and the frustration I found a love
          for programming.
          <br />
          <br />I then decided to enroll in a "Intro to Programming" class at
          Volunteer State Community College where I completed the class with a
          97%. During this time I also heard about{" "}

          . I talked with my professor and ultimately decided to apply to NSS,
          he graciously wrote a{" "}

          <br />
          After a few weeks and going through the interview process I was
          accepted into Nashville Software School intensive 6 month bootcamp for
          full-stack developers with a start date of 02/12/24. For the next 6
          months, Monday-Friday I spent infront of my computer in zoom calls
          with my classmates working through the curriculum, struggling together
          on group projects and laughing through it.
          <br />
          <br />
          As I progressed through NSS, I realized that coding was more than just
          a skill, it was a passion. Each challenge pushed me to think
          critically, and every group project strengthened my ability to
          collaborate with others in meaningful ways. Completing NSS marked the
          beginning of a new chapter in my life where Iâ€™m eager to keep learning
          new technologies, adapting, and building solutions that make a
          difference.
